                    chooses to grow the brown coloured cotton crop. The seed variety is rain-fed, pest resistant,
                    organically grown, and developed by the local cotton research centre. But in the village there
                    are

                    the
                    government of India.
                    Two journalists are looking to spread information to curb the practise, through a multimedia
                    campaign with feature stories, photo essays, videos, and events, to end the life-threatening,
                    inhumane and casteist practice of manual cleaning of sewers in a targeted manner in Bengaluru.
                    The campaign aims to eradicate the practice by having one robotic cleaner in each of the 198
                    civic
                    governance wards, while making every Bengalurean aware of the illegality, insensitivity of the

                    assault to share their experience without the fear of being judged and shamed while further
                    magnifying the visibility of the issue.
                    For survivors of sexual assault across Karnataka, a repository of audio testimonials will be a
                    place
                    of connection and healing. In addition, a space is required to conserve the clothing, and

                    Works
                    into an urban commons accessible to all of Bengaluru. He aims to convert derelict spaces into

                    rural-urban migration. As a part of the project, locally produced silk waste or up-cycled yarn

                    used in recreating textiles rooted in Karnataka’s heritage.
                    The Reimagining Handlooms in Karnataka wants to reach out to the villages to inspire the youth
                    to
                    take up the old traditions of weaving. The repository of oral stories collected from the older
                    generation of weavers acts as an archive of knowledge influencing the future of traditional
                    weaves
                    and designs, while diversifying livelihoods in Karnataka.

                <p>One Battle Won and Many to Conquer is a campaign built around a video on the IPC 377 Judgement -
                    decriminalizing same-sex consensual sexual relations between adults in India.
                    The project is helmed by Sangama, a veteran organization fighting for the rights of LGBTQIA+ in
                    and
                    around Karnataka. The project will facilitate the sexual minority communities across Karnataka
                    to
                    understand the implications of the judgement.
                    What the judgement means to sexual minorities from different backgrounds, and the new
                    possibilities
                    and challenges that face them, such new and significant shifts in society need to be documented
                    and
                    studied. Towards forging these new impacts the project will create the possibility for Sangama
                    to
                    inclusively decide future campaigns based on the inputs gathered from community members across
                    Karnataka.

                    years in

                    hers
                    seldom make the news.
                    The project Her Storiesby Co-Media Lab, is aimed at making and distributing similar short videos

                    mobility
                    within the city functions far beyond the parameters of civility, where streets increasingly are
                    experienced as inhospitable places, especially for pedestrians and cyclists.

                    towards
